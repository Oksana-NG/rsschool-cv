## Summary

This year I started working as a junior QA Engineer. I enjoy working in the IT industry, where I can participate in creating useful and unique products, helping to make them better and well-worked.    
I enjoy learning and developing my skills. This year I finished my basic HTML and CSS course and started learning Javascript at Codecademy. I am working and at the same time studying Web Development, which helps me to better fulfil my current responsibilities.     
I am responsible and ambitious, I like working in a team, but it is also not difficult for me to work alone. It is a good time to do my best.
